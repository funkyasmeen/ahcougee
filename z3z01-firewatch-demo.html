\/r/games blocks the entire twitch.tv domain in an attempt to block all Let's Plays, so PAX panels have to be self posts. Here's the link to the Firewatch demo ( (the Q/A's right after). That link skips the Campo Santo devs introducing themselves and goes straight to the demo. If you want to see from the beginning anyway, here's a link starting from there (http://www.twitch.tv/pax2/b/563131781?t=23h17m00s). Firewatch is a first-person single-player mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness, where your only emotional lifeline is the person on the other end of a handheld radio. Продажи Cyberpunk 2077 на PS4 могут пострадать из-за недавней цензуры в Devil Firewatch devs are 'all Valve employees now' but retain creative freedom. By Joe Donnelly  News "You're not dictated why it's done a certain way, it's up to you to have the wherewithal to learn how things are done.". 
Check out hilarious, suspenseful, and strange scenes from this stunning first-person adventure. So I have yet 15 eur to spent on this sales and need some good suggestions. I play every kind of games so don't be shy:) Thanks.  Firewatch is a single-player first-person mystery set in the Wyoming wilderness, where your only emotional lifeline is the person on the other end of a handheld radio. I really want to give The Witness a shot because I've been hearing so many great things about and I love challenging games. At the same time Firewatch is dropping next week and it looks very promising (kind of reminds me of Gone Home in a way except you're outdoors). So yeah, I'd like to get to know what you guys are planning to play in the indie games department. In Firewatch you play as a man named Henry who has retreated from his messy life to work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched high atop a mountain, it's your job to look for smoke Firewatch is an adventure game developed by Campo Santo and published by Campo Santo in partnership with Panic. The game was released in February 2016 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, and PlayStation 4, for Xbox One in September 2016, and for Nintendo Switch in December. Fire and Rescue software, FireWatch connects prevention, resource planning and response to reveal the complete picture of your fire service operations. 
Here's (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c04De8040Ng) a few snapshots of the beginning moments of the game. There's a bit of gameplay where I discuss the view acceleration and some graphical problems that need to be addressed. You knew Panic was making a game, right? Technically, we're not actually making the game — we provided the funds to launch both a brand new game studio, Campo Santo, and an ambitious upcoming game… Firewatch. Panic is, I guess, the "publisher", although to me that conjures.

If you watched the PAX demo for Firewatch last year, this may sound familiar -- but this is a deeper look at Henry's interactions with Delilah, how he navigates the world, and the mysterious occurrences that will set its story in motion. 
I wanted to put together this post because I wanted to provide some insight into my experiences with the engines as someone who is primarily an artist, though not unfamiliar with programming, and who has spent years with Unity as a hobbyist wanting to actually make the leap into something bigger. Hopefully this can provide some encouragement and give you a fresh perspective if you're like me and been finding yourself frustrated.
